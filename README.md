# Airflow Intermediate Training
### Airflow Intermediate Training Material

The main purpose of this material is to store the source code to test an Airflow Ready to Use environment.

Hope you have fun using the code that is written here, it is a compendium of a lot of hours of Airflow trainings and I have gathered a lot of information to set this repo ready.

If you have any recommendation, bug or anything you would like to share, don't hesitate asking to collaborate in this repository.

There's no way to learn to code just watching training videos, just messing up around is the onlye way that you are going to master great programming skills.

Welcome and enjoy!

### Basic Setup to use this training material

Yo will need to install a virtual box machine using Ubuntu, or another Linux distribution
